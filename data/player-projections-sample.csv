Anthony Davis,Expecting his numbers to bounce-back after his less than memorable final season in New Orleans. He'll be the number 1 player in fantasy this season so long as he can play over 72 games.,"PF,C",LAL,74,36,0.52,10,19.3,0.82,6.6,8.1,1,27.7,11.3,3.5,1.7,2.6,2.2
James Harden,"Harden's usage also takes a hit with Westbrook. Don't get me wrong; he'll still be a top fantasy player, just don't expect numbers from last season (which were inflated with Paul missing so many games).","PG,SG",HOU,78,36,0.45,9.4,21.1,0.87,8.9,10.2,3.9,31.7,5.6,6.8,2.1,0.7,4.4
Stephen Curry,Curry is in for an MVP type season as he takes on a more significant chunk of the offensive load. Should still be producing elite numbers for a few more seasons.,"PG,SG",GSW,76,35,0.48,10.1,21.1,0.91,4.2,4.6,5.6,29.8,5.9,5.7,1.5,0.4,2.9
Giannis Antetokounmpo,"Expecting small improvements to Giannis. He showed signs of an improved outside shot (1.2 3PM post-all-star) and FT% (75.9% post-all-star) towards the end of last season, and if he remains at that level through next season, he'll be in the mix as a top pick for years to come.","SF,PF",MIL,72,33,0.57,10.2,18.1,0.74,7.3,9.8,0.9,28.7,13.2,6.2,1.3,1.6,3.4
Karl-Anthony Towns,Should see slight increases in scoring with a full season removed from Butler and will be in the mix as a top pick in almost all formats of the game for years to come.,C,MIN,79,33,0.52,9.3,18,0.85,5.2,6.1,1.9,25.6,12.4,3.6,0.9,1.7,3.1
Joel Embiid,"A top fantasy contributor until you factor in games played and has yet to play more than 64 games in his first three seasons in the NBA. Missing a handful of games each season might become the norm with Embiid, so factor that in on draft day, but don't let it discourage you, he's still an elite talent.","PF,C",PHI,66,32,0.49,9.1,18.6,0.81,8.2,10.2,1.2,27.6,13.6,3.7,0.7,1.9,3.3
Nikola Jokic,"He's never going to be a big blocks guy, but he makes up for it in other categories and could get close to averaging eight assists at some point in his career. Destined to be a top 6 guy and he's just about to enter his prime.","PF,C",DEN,78,32,0.51,8.3,16.2,0.82,3.9,4.7,1.1,21.6,11.7,7.8,1.4,0.8,3.2
Paul George,"Should miss some games to start the season as he recovers from surgery, and I'm expecting both Kawhi and himself to get the load management treatment, so don't expect a full season.","SF,PF",LAC,66,35,0.45,7.7,17,0.84,5.1,6.1,3.8,24.2,8.2,4.1,2,0.4,2.6
Kawhi Leonard,"The best hired gun in the league should be ready to prove that he's able to do it again. With George expected to miss games early, he'll be expected to carry the team as he did in Toronto. There will be external pressure for him not to sit games in the loaded Western Conference, but the Clippers should be smart about it. I'll be surprised if he plays more than 68-70 games this season.","SG,SF",LAC,68,34,0.5,8,16,0.86,6,7.1,2,24.1,7,3.5,1.8,0.6,2
Damian Lillard,Has been an end of the first round guy for the past few seasons and his game should age well. Don't expect much to change.,PG,POR,80,36,0.44,9.1,20.4,0.91,6.2,6.8,3.2,27.6,3.8,7,1.1,0.4,2.6
